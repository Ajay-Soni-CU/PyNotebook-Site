# 🚀 JupyterLab Interface — Browser-Based Python Notebook with AI Assistant 🤖
python -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000
```


### Example Workflow
1. Create a new notebook tab.
2. Run code cells with Ctrl+Enter.
3. Trigger AI for auto-generation with @ commands.
4. Chat with the AI for debugging and conceptual help.
5. Export notebook as `.ipynb` for sharing.
